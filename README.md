# PPUC config-tool

The PPUC config-tool is a web application to configure your controllers. it is
still WIP.

## Development

### macOS

Install [hombrew](https://brew.sh/).

Now install DDEV. Details about that process could be found
[here](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/docker-installation/#macos).
But these are the essential steps:
```sh
brew install docker
brew install colima
brew install drud/ddev/ddev
mkcert -install
colima start --cpu 4 --memory 6 --disk 100 --dns=1.1.1.1
```
When your computer restarts, youâ€™ll need to run `colima start` again.

Now clone this project somewhere in your home directory.
It is recommended to create a PPUC directory first where you can also clone
other PPUC components.
```
mkdir PPUC
cd PPUC
git clone https://github.com/PPUC/config-tool.git
cd config-tool
ddev start
```

```
ddev ssh
```
```
drush si ppuc --site-name="Pinball Power-Up Controller" --account-name=ppuc --account-pass=ppuc
exit
```

Now you can open https://ppuc-config-tool.ddev.site/ in your browser and login
using _ppuc_ as username and _ppuc_ as password.

When you restart your computer you need to start colima and ddev:
```
colima start
cd PPUC/config-tool
ddev start
```

Once ddev has been started you can also update to the latest version of the
config-tool. It is recommended to export your games before performing the update.
Within `PPUC/config-tool` run
```
ddev snapshot
git pull
ddev ssh
```
```
drush updb
exit
```
